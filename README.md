# CSV Data Matcher

## Description
A PHP based web application that enables users to upload two or more CSV datasets, specify matching parameters, visualize matches, and generate optimal matches. This is ideal for applications where you need to match people by a set of criteria (for example, find the ideal mentor for every student)

## CSV Data Format
The first row of each CSV dataset must contain the heading/title of each column. Each subsequent row will represent an item that will be matched with a row of another CSV dataset.
